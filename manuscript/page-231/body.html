Hence an oceanic island at first sight seems to have been highly favourable for the production of new species. But we may thus greatly deceive ourselves, for to ascertain whether a small isolated area, or a large open area like a continent, has been most favourable for the production of new organic forms, we ought to make the comparison within equal times; and this we are incapable of doing.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Although I do not doubt that isolation is of considerable importance in the production of new species, on the whole I am inclined to believe that</p></div> </div>
