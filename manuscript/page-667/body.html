In regard to the Invertebrata, Barrande, and a higher authority could not be named, asserts that he is every day taught that palaeozoic animals, though belonging to the same orders, families, or genera with those living at the present day, were not at this early epoch limited in such distinct groups as they now are.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Some writers have objected to any extinct species or</p></div> </div>
