Amongst existing Vertebrata, we find but a small amount of gradation in the structure of the eye, and from fossil species we can learn nothing on this head. In this great class we should probably have to descend far beneath the lowest known fossiliferous stratum to discover the earlier stages, by which the eye has been perfected.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">In the Articulata we can commence a series with an optic nerve merely coated with pigment, and without</p></div> </div>
