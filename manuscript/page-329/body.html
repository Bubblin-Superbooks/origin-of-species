I do not see that any explanation can be given. But on the view of species being only strongly marked and fixed varieties, we might surely expect to find them still often continuing to vary in those parts of their structure which have varied within a moderately recent period, and which have thus come to differ. Or to state the case in another manner:â€”the points in which all the species of a genus resemble each other, and in which they differ from the species of some other genus, are called generic characters; and these characters</p></div> </div>
